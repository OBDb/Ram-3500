    description: "The fourth generation Ram 3500 Heavy Duty represented the pinnacle of Ram's work-focused trucks after the brand's separation from Dodge. Built on a fully boxed frame with enhanced strength for maximum capability, this one-ton truck was designed for serious towing and hauling applications. Available in single rear wheel (SRW) or dual rear wheel (DRW) configurations, the Ram 3500 offered a standard 5.7L HEMI V8 engine, with a 6.4L HEMI V8 added in 2014. However, the powertrain most associated with the Ram 3500 was the 6.7L Cummins turbo diesel inline-six, which saw continuous improvement throughout this generation, eventually reaching 385 horsepower and 900 lb-ft of torque by 2018. When properly equipped, towing capacity exceeded 30,000 pounds, placing it among the most capable consumer trucks available. The Ram 3500 was available in regular cab, crew cab, and Mega Cab body styles with various bed lengths. Inside, the 3500 offered surprising refinement for a work truck, with top trim levels featuring premium leather, wood accents, heated and ventilated seats, and advanced infotainment systems. The available Auto-Level Rear Air Suspension was unique among heavy-duty pickups, allowing for automatic load-leveling when towing or hauling. The fourth generation received updates throughout its run, with significant refreshes in 2013 and 2016 bringing more modern styling, improved interiors, and enhanced capability."

    description: "The fifth generation Ram 3500 Heavy Duty launched for the 2019 model year with a comprehensive redesign focused on setting new benchmarks for capability, technology, and comfort in the one-ton truck segment. Built on a redesigned frame utilizing 98.5% high-strength steel, the new generation offers significantly improved rigidity and durability to handle extreme towing and hauling demands. Engine options include a standard 6.4L HEMI V8 producing 410 horsepower and 429 lb-ft of torque paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. The optional 6.7L Cummins turbo diesel is available in two variants: a standard output version with 370 horsepower and 850 lb-ft of torque and a high-output version producing 400 horsepower and an industry-first 1,000 lb-ft of torque (later increased to 420 hp and 1,075 lb-ft), mated to a six-speed automatic transmission. This immense power enables properly equipped models to tow more than 35,000 pounds with fifth-wheel/gooseneck hitches, with conventional towing exceeding 20,000 pounds. Available in single or dual rear wheel configurations and in regular cab, crew cab, and Mega Cab body styles with various bed lengths, the Ram 3500 offers configurations suited for diverse heavy-duty applications. Despite its work-focused nature, the interior mirrors the premium appointments of the light-duty Ram 1500, featuring the available 12-inch vertical touchscreen, active noise cancellation, and luxury features previously unheard of in the heavy-duty segment. Advanced technology extends to towing assistance, with available features including a 360-degree camera system, trailer reverse guidance, and tire pressure monitoring for trailer tires. The suspension system features upgraded components including progressive springs and frequency response damping shocks to balance load capacity with improved ride quality. From the work-oriented Tradesman to the ultra-luxury Limited and off-road-capable Power Wagon trims, the fifth-generation Ram 3500 has redefined expectations for heavy-duty trucks by combining class-leading capability with unprecedented refinement and technology."
